0:15--Can you show your mind tonight?
0:20--Can you show your mind tonight?
0:25--Is there a spiderweb in my head?
0:29--Things keep getting tangled
0:32--My heart is tangled even more than that and it's your fault.
0:42--You, the one love in a world I can't have
0:46--Keep coming to me
0:51--Did you know that my feet only look for you without my knowing?
0:57--Dizzy lonely tonight...
1:01--It seems like I became two different people after meeting you
1:06--Little by little, one by one, I'm changing
1:10--It's so weird, this fluttering feeling mixed with nervousness in my heart
1:16--Maybe I'm scared that I'll lose you
1:17--I want to get to know your world that is unknown to  me
1:24--Tell me, let me hear it, show me yourself
1:27--Even the air around us is different so can we really fall in love?
1:34--You are too perfect for me
1:35--A headache came before love
1:40--All day, it felt like the night
1:45--Did you know that I want to have your morning?
1:50--Dizzy lonely tonight...
1:54--It seems like I became two different people after meeting you
1:59--Little by little, one by one, I'm changing.
2:03--It's so weird, this fluttering feeling mixed with nervousness in my heart
2:09--Maybe I'm scared that I'll lose you
2:12--I want to get to know your world that is unknown to me
2:17--Tell me, le me hear it, show me your self
2:21--Even the air around us is different so can we really fall in love?
2:28--Make me feel special
2:48--I want to believe in serendipity, the hand of fate
2:53--Hopefully I wanted to be one, not two
2:58--I hope we were put in the same place so I could recognize you
3:04--Please recognize me too
3:06--I want to get to know your world that's unknown to me
3:12--Tell me, let me hear it, show me yourself
3:15--Even the air around us is different so can we really fall in love?
3:22--Make me feel special
